### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is [Your Name] and I am a student at Bloomtech, currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program for Software Engineering. My passion for software engineering has driven me to develop a strong skill set in both frontend and backend technologies. I have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and have also gained proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming and algorithms. I am constantly striving to learn and improve my skills in the field of software engineering. On this page, you will find a collection of my projects and contributions to the open-source community. Feel free to take a look around and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
